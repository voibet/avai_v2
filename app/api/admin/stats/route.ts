 * POST - Run statistics calculations

 * - fixtureIds: Array of fixture IDs to process (optional - when provided, ELO calculations use incremental mode with existing ratings)
 * - createViews: Boolean to create database views (optional, default: false)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - When fixtureIds is provided: ELO calculations use incremental mode (preserves existing team ratings from previous fixtures)
 * - When fixtureIds is null/omitted: Full recalculation mode (all statistics recalculated from league base ELOs)
 * - ELO calculations automatically detect the mode and handle existing ratings appropriately
 * - Other calculations (hours, goals, home advantage, rolling XG) work the same in both modes
